I'm a **Full Stack developer** who honed my technical and soft skills from my Mathematics and Computer

Science studies and Full Stack Software Engineering Programme at ALX. I believe that continuous

learning is essential in the technology industry, and I am always committed to staying up to date with

the latest trends and developments. I'm also proud to have graduated in the top 5% of the ALX Tech

program and been selected for the Gold Fellowship program at The ROOM.
